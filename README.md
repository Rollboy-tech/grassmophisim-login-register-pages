# Grassmophisim — Login & Register Front-end Demo

Professional, minimal front-end demonstration of a login and registration UI designed with a glassmorphism aesthetic. This project is intended for learning, prototyping, and UI demonstrations. It does not include a backend or persistent authentication.

## Overview

- Two pages: `login.html` and `signup.html` with a shared stylesheet and script.
- Client-side validation and user-feedback for email and password fields.
- Simulated login/registration flows for demo purposes only (no credentials are sent to a server).

## Project structure

- `login.html` — Login page
- `signup.html` — Registration page
- `style.css` — Styling (glassmorphism look)
- `script.js` — Client-side validation and simulated flows

## Quick start

1. Open `login.html` or `signup.html` in your browser.
2. Interact with the form fields to see inline validation and simulated submit flows.

No build step required — this is plain HTML/CSS/JS.

## Usage notes

- Replace the client-side simulation with secure server-side authentication for production.
- Do not store raw passwords client-side. Use secure tokens and HTTPS when integrating backends.

If you need me to integrate backend endpoints, CI, or improve accessibility, open an issue describing the requirements and I can implement it.
